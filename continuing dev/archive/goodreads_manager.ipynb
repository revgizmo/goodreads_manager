It’s a great book when building on other theories and providing examples, but it’s at its worst when describing the development and process of the Grit theory itself.  How is it different than Carol Dwek’s Growth Mindset?  She even mentions that in every avenue examined, Growth Mindset and Grit go together.  It’s not really clear why other than so that she gets to put her name on the Theory.  It seems that recent science (per wikipedia) bears out that there's little meaningful difference between Grit and Conscientiousness (from the Big 5 Traits)\n",

I started and stopped the audiobook a couple times, both due to the current political climate (I read this as the Weinstein/Hollywood/Policical sexual harrassment scandals were ramping up), and because I didn't feel compelled by the narrative.  I'm glad that I have experienced it, but I was hoping for something better and groundbreaking or truly thought provoking.

It’s a great book when building on other theories and providing examples, but it’s at its worst when describing the development and process of the Grit theory itself.  How is it different than Carol Dwek’s Growth Mindset?  She even mentions that in every avenue examined, Growth Mindset and Grit go together.  It’s not really clear why other than so that she gets to put her name on the Theory.  It seems that recent science (per wikipedia) bears out that there's little meaningful difference between Grit and Conscientiousness (from the Big 5 Traits)\n",

And therefore, in the long run, the condition for the continued stasis of Sparta (which means its continued existence, as they see it) is the destruction of progress in Athens (which from our perspective would constitute the destruction of Athens).”:    <br>   “The scientific revolution was part of a wider intellectual revolution, the Enlightenment, which also brought progress in other fields, especially moral and political philosophy, and in the institutions of society. Unfortunately, the term ‘the Enlightenment’ is used by historians and philosophers to denote a variety of different trends, some of them violently opposed to each other. What I mean by it will emerge here as we go along. It is one of several aspects of ‘the beginning of infinity’, and is a theme of this book. But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.”:    <br>   “Sparta has no philosophers. That’s because the job of a philosopher is to understand things better, which is a form of change, so they don’t want it. Another difference: they don’t honour living poets, only dead ones. Why? Because dead poets don’t write anything new, but live ones do. A third difference: their education system is insanely harsh; ours is famously lax. Why? Because they don’t want their kids to dare to question anything, so that they won’t ever think of changing anything.”: : : Data can be used to find incredibly interesting and noble things from surprising sources.
