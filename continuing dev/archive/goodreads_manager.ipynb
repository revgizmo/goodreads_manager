It’s a great book when building on other theories and providing examples, but it’s at its worst when describing the development and process of the Grit theory itself.  How is it different than Carol Dwek’s Growth Mindset?  She even mentions that in every avenue examined, Growth Mindset and Grit go together.  It’s not really clear why other than so that she gets to put her name on the Theory.  It seems that recent science (per wikipedia) bears out that there's little meaningful difference between Grit and Conscientiousness (from the Big 5 Traits)\n",

And therefore, in the long run, the condition for the continued stasis of Sparta (which means its continued existence, as they see it) is the destruction of progress in Athens (which from our perspective would constitute the destruction of Athens).”:    <br>   “The scientific revolution was part of a wider intellectual revolution, the Enlightenment, which also brought progress in other fields, especially moral and political philosophy, and in the institutions of society. Unfortunately, the term ‘the Enlightenment’ is used by historians and philosophers to denote a variety of different trends, some of them violently opposed to each other. What I mean by it will emerge here as we go along. It is one of several aspects of ‘the beginning of infinity’, and is a theme of this book. But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.”:    <br>   “Sparta has no philosophers. That’s because the job of a philosopher is to understand things better, which is a form of change, so they don’t want it. Another difference: they don’t honour living poets, only dead ones. Why? Because dead poets don’t write anything new, but live ones do. A third difference: their education system is insanely harsh; ours is famously lax. Why? Because they don’t want their kids to dare to question anything, so that they won’t ever think of changing anything.”: : : Data can be used to find incredibly interesting and noble things from surprising sources.

      "The Big Idea:\\n\\n\"The book was very focused on Leaning In to ones career, with a strong focus on the careers and lives of women in the 21st century. Through personal and narrative examples she tries to demonstrate how she thinks about work/life balnce, how careers are jungle gyms rather than ladders, and how we might find a future where women and men are not the same but are equal. \\n\\nI don’t know whether it’s that she’s preaching to the choir and I already believe, a latent unrecognized sexism, or just a disconnect between her as a senior executive who’s been lucky and successful and the reality of most people, but this book was just OK to me.  I started and stopped the audiobook a couple times, both due to the current political climate (I read this as the Weinstein/Hollywood/Policical sexual harrassment scandals were ramping up), and because I didn't feel compelled by the narrative.  I'm glad that I have experienced it, but I was hoping for something better and groundbreaking or truly thought provoking. Maybe my expectations were just too high. The things that stuck with me were smaller things that were less related to the main theme, but mostly this was an ok business memoir. \"\\n \\nHighlights:\\n \\n\"“Leadership is about making others better as a result of your presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence.\"\"\\n(Harvard Business School definition of leadership).

      "The Big Idea:\\n\\n\"Public letter  to his son from an educated black man about the trials and tribulations of living in modern America, with insights into the life of minorities (and African-Americans in particular) and the realities of “race”. This is a book full of quotes.

I propose to take our countrymen’s claims of American exceptionalism seriously, which is to say I propose subjecting our country to an exceptional moral standard.” \\n\\n“Not being violent enough could cost me my body. Being too violent could cost me my body. We could not get out.” \\n\\n“Here is what I would like for you to know: In America, it is traditional to destroy the black body—it is heritage. Enslavement was not merely the antiseptic borrowing of labor—it is not so easy to get a human being to commit their body against its own elemental interest. And so enslavement must be casual wrath and random manglings, the gashing of heads and brains blown out over the river as the body seeks to escape. It must be rape so regular as to be industrial. There is no uplifting way to say this. I have no praise anthems, nor old Negro spirituals. The spirit and soul are the body and brain, which are destructible—that is precisely why they are so precious. And the soul did not escape. The spirit did not steal away on gospel wings.

      "The Big Idea:\\n\\n\"“When designing your life, you start with who you are (chapters 1, 2, and 3). Then you have lots of ideas (rather than wait and wait to have the idea of the century) and you try things out by doing them (chapters 4, 5, and 6), and then you make the best choice you can (chapter 8). As you do all this, including making choices that set you on one path for a number of years, you grow various aspects of your personality and identity that are nurtured and called upon by those experiences—you become more yourself. In this way, you energize a very productive cycle of growth, naturally evolving from being, to doing, to becoming. Then it all repeats, as the more-like-you version of you (your new being) takes the next step of doing, and so it goes.” \\n\\nStanford  professors in the Design Department teach the most popular class at Stanford: Designing Your Life.  This is their book with the same goal.\"\\n \\nHighlights:\\n \\n“For most people, passion comes after they try something, discover they like it, and develop mastery - not before. To put it more succinctly: passion is the result of a good life design, not the cause.” \\n\\n\"\\n“These are all gravity problems—meaning they are not real problems. Why? Because in life design, if it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem. Let’s repeat that. If it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem. It’s a situation, a circumstance, a fact of life. It may be a drag (so to speak), but, like gravity, it’s not a problem that can be solved.” \\n\\nGravity problems: if it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem. Two types of gravity problems: totally un-actionable and functionally un-actionable.  Either way, focus on finding actionable solutions to actionable problems\"\\n\\n\"“That’s why you start where you are. Not where you wish you were. Not where you hope you are. Not where you think you should be. But right where you are.” \\n\\n\\n“As a life designer, you need to embrace two philosophies: 1. You choose better when you have lots of good ideas to choose from. 2. You never choose your first solution to any problem.” \\n\"\\n\\n\\nActionable Items:\\n\\n\"Health/Work/Play/Love dashboard:\\n\\nConsider updating Todoist to align with this framework?\\nAlign with 1 Big Thing idea and make sure there's something going for each at all times?\\n\\n\"\\n\\n\"Re-read/do the exercises in the book:\\nHealth/Work/Play/Love dashboard.

      "The Big Idea:\\n\\nThought provoking look at the history of humanity that roughly follows the evolutionary history of homo sapiens sapiens and highlights the inflection points of cognitive, agricultural, and scientific revolutions. \\n \\nHighlights:\\n \\n“Even worse, greedy bosses might curtail the workers’ freedom of movement through debt peonage or slavery. At the end of the Middle Ages, slavery was almost unknown in Christian Europe. During the early modern period, the rise of European capitalism went hand in hand with the rise of the Atlantic slave trade. Unrestrained market forces, rather than tyrannical kings or racist ideologues, were responsible for this calamity.” \\n\\nThis quote stuck with me most among many thoughts from this great book. \\n\\n“The Scientific Revolution has not been a revolution of knowledge. It has been above all a revolution of ignorance. The great discovery that launched the Scientific Revolution was the discovery that humans do not know the answers to their most important questions.“\\n\\nSuch a beautiful analysis of the naturalist vs religious viewpoints\"\\n\\n\"There is great discussion about the usefulness of untrue claims. The discussion of equality and the analysis of the Declaration of Independence were particularly thought provoking:\\n\\n“According to the science of biology, people were not ‘created’. They have evolved. And they certainly did not evolve to be ‘equal’. The idea of equality is inextricably intertwined with the idea of creation. The Americans got the idea of equality from Christianity, which argues that every person has a divinely created soul, and that all souls are equal before God. However, if we do not believe in the Christian myths about God, creation and souls, what does it mean that all people are ‘equal’?”\\n\\n\\nActionable Items:\\n\\nReread Sapiens\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Notes & Takeaways:\\nThis book seems like one where you should come back to it regularly to use in recalibration get thoughts about the world.

      "The Big Idea:\\n\\nMan had the choice to choose a life of academics in particle physics and a nobel prize, or a family life.  Chose the family life.  In another dimension of the branching timeline, a different version of protagonist creates a machine to travel between different worlds (same location, same time).  Adventure ensues\\n \\nHighlights:\\n \\n\"“No one tells you it’s all about to change, to be taken away. There’s no proximity alert, no indication that you’re standing on the precipice. And maybe that’s what makes tragedy so tragic. Not just what happens, but how it happens: a sucker punch that comes at you out of nowhere, when you’re least expecting it. No time to flinch or brace.” \\n\"\\n\\n\"“Imagine you’re a fish, swimming in a pond. You can move forward and back, side to side, but never up out of the water. If someone were standing beside the pond, watching you, you’d have no idea they were there. To you, that little pond is an entire universe. Now imagine that someone reaches down and lifts you out of the pond. You see that what you thought was the entire world is only a small pool. You see other ponds. Trees. The sky above.

      "The Big Idea:\\n\\n\"Henrietta Lacks was unknown before this book, even though a culture of her cancer cells was the first and most successful human cell line used in a huge variety of medical experiments. The story covers her life, the story of her family through the books publication, and the science behind the cell line. \\n\\nThe author did an excellent job of capturing the humanity behind the people in this true and amazing story\"\\n \\nHighlights:\\n \\n“She's the most important person in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?” \\n\\n“Henrietta’s cells have now been living outside her body far longer than they ever lived inside it,”\\n\\n\"\"\"There is no evidence that the scientists who did research on patients at Crownsville got consent from either the patients of their parents. Bases on the number of patients listed in the pneumoencephalography studyand the years it was conducted, Lurz told me later, it most likely involved every epileptic child in the hospital including Elsie.

Still think she would have made a good president though. \\n\\n\\n\\nFormat Consumed:\\nAudiobook                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "The Big Idea\\n\\nSuccess equals effort times skill. Skill equals talent times effort. Effort counts twice.\\n\\nThis book feels like it doesn’t really deserve its own named theory. It’s a great book when building on other theories and providing examples, but it’s at its worst when describing the development and process of the Grit theory itself. How is it different than Carol Dwek’s Growth Mindset? She even mentions that in every avenue examined, Growth Mindset and Grit go together.

But getting back on the treadmill the next day, eager to try again, is in my view even more reflective of grit. Because when you don’t come back the next day—when you permanently turn your back on a commitment—your effort plummets to zero.

      "The Big Idea:\\n\\n\"Change accelerates change and we’re moving toward self-reinforcing change that will go on for infinity. Correcting mistakes allows for progress, and stasis could only be preserved without error correction (therefore is immoral).  \\n\\n“There is only one known phenomenon which, if it ever occurred, would have effects that did not fall off with distance, and that is the creation of a certain type of knowl- edge, namely a beginning of infinity. Indeed, knowledge can aim itself at a target, travel vast distances having scarcely any effect, and then utterly transform the destination.”\\n\"\\n \\nHighlights:\\n \\n“The very existence of Athens, however peaceful, is a deadly threat to Sparta’s stasis. And therefore, in the long run, the condition for the continued stasis of Sparta (which means its continued existence, as they see it) is the destruction of progress in Athens (which from our perspective would constitute the destruction of Athens).”\\n\\n“The scientific revolution was part of a wider intellectual revolution, the Enlightenment, which also brought progress in other fields, especially moral and political philosophy, and in the institutions of society. Unfortunately, the term ‘the Enlightenment’ is used by historians and philosophers to denote a variety of different trends, some of them violently opposed to each other. What I mean by it will emerge here as we go along. It is one of several aspects of ‘the beginning of infinity’, and is a theme of this book. But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.”\\n\\n“Sparta has no philosophers. That’s because the job of a philosopher is to understand things better, which is a form of change, so they don’t want it. Another difference: they don’t honour living poets, only dead ones. Why? Because dead poets don’t write anything new, but live ones do. A third difference: their education system is insanely harsh; ours is famously lax. Why?

      "Interesting insight into a Chinese setting/culture and way to characterize/understand an alien race. Ok writing. Left with a few cool ideas, and an overall sense that it was both refreshingly different and poorly written. In the end, I don’t think any of the ideas will stick with me the way the best sci-fi does.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
      "The Big Idea:\\n\\nThe serenity prayer in modern form: care about the things that support your values\\n \\nHighlights:\\n \\n\"Good values are 1) reality-based, 2) socially constructive, and 3) immediate and controllable.\\nBad values are 1) superstitious, 2) socially destructive, and 3) not immediate and controllable.\\n\\nI liked this summary\"\\n\\n\"“Nobody else is ever responsible for your situation but you. Many people may be to blame for your unhappiness, but nobody is ever responsible for your unhappiness but you.”\\n\\nThis was the single biggest takeaway I found in this book\"\\n\\n“You are already choosing, in every moment of every day, what to give a fuck about, so change is as simple as choosing to give a fuck about something else.” \\n\\n\\nActionable Items:\\n\\nDo some more thinking about responsibility and blame\\n\\nUse negative experiences to learn\\n\\nGive a fuck only about the things that matter.

Even with unprecedented access, Isaacson seems unable to capture the perspective of his subject and falls back on quotes of others much too often.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",

      "The Big Idea:\\n\\nNear term progress is inevitable?\\n \\nHighlights:\\n \\n“Over the next three decades, scholars and fans, aided by computational algorithms, will knit together the books of the world into a single networked literature. A reader will be able to generate a social graph of an idea, or a timeline of a concept, or a networked map of influence for any notion in the library. We’ll come to understand that no work, no idea stands alone, but that all good, true, and beautiful things are ecosystems of intertwined parts and related entities, past and present.” \\n\\n“Thomas Jefferson understood that ideas were not really property, or if they were property they differed from real estate. He wrote, “He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.” If Jefferson gave you his house at Monticello, you’d have his house and he wouldn’t. But if he gave you an idea, you’d have the idea and he’d still have the idea. That weirdness is the source of our uncertainty about intellectual property today.” \\n\\n“Yet the paradox of science is that every answer breeds at least two new questions. More tools, more answers, ever more questions.” \\n\\n\\nActionable Items:\\n\\nNothing, and that is part of my problem with this book\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Notes & Takeaways:\\nMeh.

      "The Big Idea:\\n\\nA mediocre review of the science around learning and review of the latest known about the popular tools to improve learning\\n \\nHighlights:\\n \\n\"“I no longer think of naps or knocking off early as evidence of laziness, or a waste of time, or, worst of all, a failure of will. I think of sleep as learning with my eyes closed.” \\nSleep and daydreaming are good for learning\"\\n\\n“And we will show that some of what we’ve been taught to think of as our worst enemies—laziness, ignorance, distraction—can also work in our favor.” \\n\\n“To say it another way, the collective findings of modern learning science provide much more than a recipe for how to learn more efficiently. They describe a way of life.” \\n\\n\\nActionable Items:\\n\\nSleep more\\n\\nWhen trying to learn, change contexts (time, place, etc.) to maximize flexibility toward the unexpected\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Notes & Takeaways:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFormat Consumed:\\nAudiobook                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",

      "\"The book was very focused on Leaning In to ones career, with a strong focus on the careers and lives of women in the 21st century. Through personal and narrative examples she tries to demonstrate how she thinks about work/life balnce, how careers are jungle gyms rather than ladders, and how we might find a future where women and men are not the same but are equal. \\n\\nI don’t know whether it’s that she’s preaching to the choir and I already believe, a latent unrecognized sexism, or just a disconnect between her as a senior executive who’s been lucky and successful and the reality of most people, but this book was just OK to me.  I started and stopped the audiobook a couple times, both due to the current political climate (I read this as the Weinstein/Hollywood/Policical sexual harrassment scandals were ramping up), and because I didn't feel compelled by the narrative.  I'm glad that I have experienced it, but I was hoping for something better and groundbreaking or truly thought provoking. Maybe my expectations were just too high. The things that stuck with me were smaller things that were less related to the main theme, but mostly this was an ok business memoir. \"    1\n",

Then you have lots of ideas (rather than wait and wait to have the idea of the century) and you try things out by doing them (chapters 4, 5, and 6), and then you make the best choice you can (chapter 8). As you do all this, including making choices that set you on one path for a number of years, you grow various aspects of your personality and identity that are nurtured and called upon by those experiences—you become more yourself. In this way, you energize a very productive cycle of growth, naturally evolving from being, to doing, to becoming.

Being too violent could cost me my body. We could not get out.” \\n\\n“Here is what I would like for you to know: In America, it is traditional to destroy the black body—it is heritage. Enslavement was not merely the antiseptic borrowing of labor—it is not so easy to get a human being to commit their body against its own elemental interest. And so enslavement must be casual wrath and random manglings, the gashing of heads and brains blown out over the river as the body seeks to escape. It must be rape so regular as to be industrial. There is no uplifting way to say this. I have no praise anthems, nor old Negro spirituals. The spirit and soul are the body and brain, which are destructible—that is precisely why they are so precious. And the soul did not escape. The spirit did not steal away on gospel wings. The soul was the body that fed the tobacco, and the spirit was the blood that watered the cotton, and these created the first fruits of the American garden. And the fruits were secured through the bashing of children with stovewood, through hot iron peeling skin away like husk from corn.” \"    1\n",

Unfortunately, the term ‘the Enlightenment’ is used by historians and philosophers to denote a variety of different trends, some of them violently opposed to each other. What I mean by it will emerge here as we go along. It is one of several aspects of ‘the beginning of infinity’, and is a theme of this book. But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.”\\n\\n“Sparta has no philosophers.

Because dead poets don’t write anything new, but live ones do. A third difference: their education system is insanely harsh; ours is famously lax. Why?
