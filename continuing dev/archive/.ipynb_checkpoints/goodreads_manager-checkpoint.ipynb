The story covers her life, the story of her family through the books publication, and the science behind the cell line. <br/><br/>The author did an excellent job of capturing the humanity behind the people in this true and amazing story\"<br/> <br/>\n",
      "\tHighlights: <br/> <br/>“She's the most important person in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?” <br/><br/>“Henrietta’s cells have now been living outside her body far longer than they ever lived inside it,”<br/><br/>\"\"\"There is no evidence that the scientists who did research on patients at Crownsville got consent from either the patients of their parents. Bases on the number of patients listed in the pneumoencephalography studyand the years it was conducted, Lurz told me later, it most likely involved every epileptic child in the hospital including Elsie. The same is likely true of at lest on other study called \"\"The Use of Deep Temporal Leads in the Study of Psychomotor Epilepsy,\"\" which involved inserting metal probes into patients' brains.” \"<br/><br/><br/>\n",

      "\tBig Idea: <br/><br/>\"“When designing your life, you start with who you are (chapters 1, 2, and 3). Then you have lots of ideas (rather than wait and wait to have the idea of the century) and you try things out by doing them (chapters 4, 5, and 6), and then you make the best choice you can (chapter 8). As you do all this, including making choices that set you on one path for a number of years, you grow various aspects of your personality and identity that are nurtured and called upon by those experiences—you become more yourself. In this way, you energize a very productive cycle of growth, naturally evolving from being, to doing, to becoming. Then it all repeats, as the more-like-you version of you (your new being) takes the next step of doing, and so it goes.” <br/><br/>Stanford  professors in the Design Department teach the most popular class at Stanford: Designing Your Life.  This is their book with the same goal.\"<br/> <br/>\n",
      "\tHighlights: <br/> <br/>“For most people, passion comes after they try something, discover they like it, and develop mastery - not before. To put it more succinctly: passion is the result of a good life design, not the cause.” <br/><br/>\"<br/>“These are all gravity problems—meaning they are not real problems. Why? Because in life design, if it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem. Let’s repeat that. If it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem. It’s a situation, a circumstance, a fact of life. It may be a drag (so to speak), but, like gravity, it’s not a problem that can be solved.” <br/><br/>Gravity problems: if it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem. Two types of gravity problems: totally un-actionable and functionally un-actionable.  Either way, focus on finding actionable solutions to actionable problems\"<br/><br/>\"“That’s why you start where you are. Not where you wish you were. Not where you hope you are. Not where you think you should be. But right where you are.” <br/><br/><br/>“As a life designer, you need to embrace two philosophies: 1. You choose better when you have lots of good ideas to choose from. 2. You never choose your first solution to any problem.” <br/>\"<br/><br/><br/>\n",
      "\tActionable Items: <br/><br/>\"Health/Work/Play/Love dashboard:<br/><br/>Consider updating Todoist to align with this framework?<br/>Align with 1 Big Thing idea and make sure there's something going for each at all times?<br/><br/>\"<br/><br/>\"Re-read/do the exercises in the book:<br/>Health/Work/Play/Love dashboard.  For each area:<br/>1. Mark where you are (0 to Full)<br/>2. Mark where you would be if you made an incremental improvement (0 to Full)<br/>3.

The question is what do you want to grow into?<br/><br/>Connect who you are, what you believe, and what you were doing.\"<br/><br/>\n",
      "\tOther Notes & Takeaways: <br/>\"There's lots to recommend, but the book itself is very focused on discussing career design, and is rather lacking in useful exercises.  It may have been an artifact of listening to the audiobook, but I listened intently but didn't finish with any form of life design plan.  Just some useful thoughts.<br/><br/>I'd say it looses a star for not being the 5 star book it could be.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

No time to flinch or brace.” <br/>\"<br/><br/>\"“Imagine you’re a fish, swimming in a pond. You can move forward and back, side to side, but never up out of the water. If someone were standing beside the pond, watching you, you’d have no idea they were there. To you, that little pond is an entire universe. Now imagine that someone reaches down and lifts you out of the pond. You see that what you thought was the entire world is only a small pool. You see other ponds. Trees. The sky above. You realize you’re a part of a much larger and more mysterious reality than you had ever dreamed of.” <br/>\"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\n",

      "\tBig Idea: <br/><br/>\"Public letter  to his son from an educated black man about the trials and tribulations of living in modern America, with insights into the life of minorities (and African-Americans in particular) and the realities of “race”. This is a book full of quotes. Lots of poetic illustrations of the realities, but I didn’t find many ideas for progress or future healing. <br/><br/>I see parallels to my personal criticisms of Sociology: “Here’s how the world is screwed up. No idea how to fix it.”\"<br/> <br/>\n",

I would have you be a conscious citizen of this terrible and beautiful world.” <br/><br/>“You are growing into consciousness, and my wish for you is that you feel no need to constrict yourself to make other people comfortable.”<br/><br/>\"“One cannot, at once, claim to be superhuman and then plead mortal error. I propose to take our countrymen’s claims of American exceptionalism seriously, which is to say I propose subjecting our country to an exceptional moral standard.” <br/><br/>“Not being violent enough could cost me my body. Being too violent could cost me my body. We could not get out.” <br/><br/>“Here is what I would like for you to know: In America, it is traditional to destroy the black body—it is heritage. Enslavement was not merely the antiseptic borrowing of labor—it is not so easy to get a human being to commit their body against its own elemental interest. And so enslavement must be casual wrath and random manglings, the gashing of heads and brains blown out over the river as the body seeks to escape. It must be rape so regular as to be industrial. There is no uplifting way to say this. I have no praise anthems, nor old Negro spirituals. The spirit and soul are the body and brain, which are destructible—that is precisely why they are so precious. And the soul did not escape. The spirit did not steal away on gospel wings. The soul was the body that fed the tobacco, and the spirit was the blood that watered the cotton, and these created the first fruits of the American garden. And the fruits were secured through the bashing of children with stovewood, through hot iron peeling skin away like husk from corn.” \"<br/><br/><br/>\n",

A reader will be able to generate a social graph of an idea, or a timeline of a concept, or a networked map of influence for any notion in the library. We’ll come to understand that no work, no idea stands alone, but that all good, true, and beautiful things are ecosystems of intertwined parts and related entities, past and present.” <br/><br/>“Thomas Jefferson understood that ideas were not really property, or if they were property they differed from real estate. He wrote, “He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.” If Jefferson gave you his house at Monticello, you’d have his house and he wouldn’t. But if he gave you an idea, you’d have the idea and he’d still have the idea. That weirdness is the source of our uncertainty about intellectual property today.” <br/><br/>“Yet the paradox of science is that every answer breeds at least two new questions.

      "\tBig Idea: <br/><br/>\"Change accelerates change and we’re moving toward self-reinforcing change that will go on for infinity. Correcting mistakes allows for progress, and stasis could only be preserved without error correction (therefore is immoral).  <br/><br/>“There is only one known phenomenon which, if it ever occurred, would have effects that did not fall off with distance, and that is the creation of a certain type of knowl- edge, namely a beginning of infinity. Indeed, knowledge can aim itself at a target, travel vast distances having scarcely any effect, and then utterly transform the destination.”<br/>\"<br/> <br/>\n",
      "\tHighlights: <br/> <br/>“The very existence of Athens, however peaceful, is a deadly threat to Sparta’s stasis. And therefore, in the long run, the condition for the continued stasis of Sparta (which means its continued existence, as they see it) is the destruction of progress in Athens (which from our perspective would constitute the destruction of Athens).”<br/><br/>“The scientific revolution was part of a wider intellectual revolution, the Enlightenment, which also brought progress in other fields, especially moral and political philosophy, and in the institutions of society. Unfortunately, the term ‘the Enlightenment’ is used by historians and philosophers to denote a variety of different trends, some of them violently opposed to each other. What I mean by it will emerge here as we go along. It is one of several aspects of ‘the beginning of infinity’, and is a theme of this book. But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.”<br/><br/>“Sparta has no philosophers. That’s because the job of a philosopher is to understand things better, which is a form of change, so they don’t want it. Another difference: they don’t honour living poets, only dead ones. Why? Because dead poets don’t write anything new, but live ones do. A third difference: their education system is insanely harsh; ours is famously lax. Why? Because they don’t want their kids to dare to question anything, so that they won’t ever think of changing anything.”<br/><br/><br/>\n",

      "\tHighlights: <br/> <br/>“Even worse, greedy bosses might curtail the workers’ freedom of movement through debt peonage or slavery. At the end of the Middle Ages, slavery was almost unknown in Christian Europe. During the early modern period, the rise of European capitalism went hand in hand with the rise of the Atlantic slave trade. Unrestrained market forces, rather than tyrannical kings or racist ideologues, were responsible for this calamity.” <br/><br/>This quote stuck with me most among many thoughts from this great book. <br/><br/>“The Scientific Revolution has not been a revolution of knowledge. It has been above all a revolution of ignorance. The great discovery that launched the Scientific Revolution was the discovery that humans do not know the answers to their most important questions.“<br/><br/>Such a beautiful analysis of the naturalist vs religious viewpoints\"<br/><br/>\"There is great discussion about the usefulness of untrue claims. The discussion of equality and the analysis of the Declaration of Independence were particularly thought provoking:<br/><br/>“According to the science of biology, people were not ‘created’. They have evolved. And they certainly did not evolve to be ‘equal’. The idea of equality is inextricably intertwined with the idea of creation. The Americans got the idea of equality from Christianity, which argues that every person has a divinely created soul, and that all souls are equal before God. However, if we do not believe in the Christian myths about God, creation and souls, what does it mean that all people are ‘equal’?”<br/><br/><br/>\n",

Through personal and narrative examples she tries to demonstrate how she thinks about work/life balnce, how careers are jungle gyms rather than ladders, and how we might find a future where women and men are not the same but are equal. <br/><br/>I don’t know whether it’s that she’s preaching to the choir and I already believe, a latent unrecognized sexism, or just a disconnect between her as a senior executive who’s been lucky and successful and the reality of most people, but this book was just OK to me.  I started and stopped the audiobook a couple times, both due to the current political climate (I read this as the Weinstein/Hollywood/Policical sexual harrassment scandals were ramping up), and because I didn't feel compelled by the narrative.  I'm glad that I have experienced it, but I was hoping for something better and groundbreaking or truly thought provoking. Maybe my expectations were just too high. The things that stuck with me were smaller things that were less related to the main theme, but mostly this was an ok business memoir. \"<br/> <br/>\n",
      "\tHighlights: <br/> <br/>\"“Leadership is about making others better as a result of your presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence.\"\"<br/>(Harvard Business School definition of leadership). This really stuck with me as a quality definition of Leadership, and one I directly aspire to emulate\"<br/><br/>“Careers are a jungle gym, not a best parts of the book that aligned with the main theme were related to this. <br/><br/>“Success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively for women. When a man is successful, he is liked by both men and women. When a woman is successful, people of both genders like her less.” I already groked this, which might be why much of the book fell flat for me. <br/><br/><br/>\n",
      "\tActionable Items: <br/><br/>Work on my own definition and process for receiving/giving mentoring<br/><br/>Actively solicit advice/request feedback<br/><br/>Manage my career/life, maybe set up Personal Board of Directors<br/><br/>\n",

      "\tOther Notes & Takeaways: The Big Idea<br/><br/>Success equals effort times skill. Skill equals talent times effort. Effort counts twice.<br/><br/>This book feels like it doesn’t really deserve its own named theory. It’s a great book when building on other theories and providing examples, but it’s at its worst when describing the development and process of the Grit theory itself. How is it different than Carol Dwek’s Growth Mindset? She even mentions that in every avenue examined, Growth Mindset and Grit go together. It’s not really clear why other than so that she gets to put her name on the Theory. It seems that recent science (per wikipedia) bears out that there's little meaningful difference between Grit and Conscientiousness (from the Big 5 Traits)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Highlights<br/><br/>Authoritative parenting or coaching: supportive and demanding<br/><br/>Growth Mindset (especially as described in her west point stories) can be developed.<br/><br/>Will Smith: ridiculous work ethic \"I will die on the treadmill\"<br/><br/>treadmill test of grit<br/><br/>\"Staying on the treadmill is one thing, and I do think it’s related to staying true to our commitments even when we’re not comfortable. But getting back on the treadmill the next day, eager to try again, is in my view even more reflective of grit. Because when you don’t come back the next day—when you permanently turn your back on a commitment—your effort plummets to zero. As a consequence, your skills stop improving, and at the same time, you stop producing anything with whatever skills you have.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Actionable Items<br/><br/>Mcconahey: sweat for an hour a day / one sweat a day<br/><br/>Three-step process for prioritizing (from Warren Buffet):<br/>• Write down your top 25 major/career goals on a single piece of paper.<br/>• Put the top five on one list and the remaining 20 on a second list.<br/>• Circle only your top five options.

And therefore, in the long run, the condition for the continued stasis of Sparta (which means its continued existence, as they see it) is the destruction of progress in Athens (which from our perspective would constitute the destruction of Athens).”:    <br>   “The scientific revolution was part of a wider intellectual revolution, the Enlightenment, which also brought progress in other fields, especially moral and political philosophy, and in the institutions of society. Unfortunately, the term ‘the Enlightenment’ is used by historians and philosophers to denote a variety of different trends, some of them violently opposed to each other. What I mean by it will emerge here as we go along. It is one of several aspects of ‘the beginning of infinity’, and is a theme of this book. But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.”:    <br>   “Sparta has no philosophers. That’s because the job of a philosopher is to understand things better, which is a form of change, so they don’t want it. Another difference: they don’t honour living poets, only dead ones. Why? Because dead poets don’t write anything new, but live ones do. A third difference: their education system is insanely harsh; ours is famously lax. Why? Because they don’t want their kids to dare to question anything, so that they won’t ever think of changing anything.”: : : Data can be used to find incredibly interesting and noble things from surprising sources.

      "\tBig Idea: <br/><br/>\"“When designing your life, you start with who you are (chapters 1, 2, and 3). Then you have lots of ideas (rather than wait and wait to have the idea of the century) and you try things out by doing them (chapters 4, 5, and 6), and then you make the best choice you can (chapter 8). As you do all this, including making choices that set you on one path for a number of years, you grow various aspects of your personality and identity that are nurtured and called upon by those experiences—you become more yourself. In this way, you energize a very productive cycle of growth, naturally evolving from being, to doing, to becoming. Then it all repeats, as the more-like-you version of you (your new being) takes the next step of doing, and so it goes.” <br/><br/>Stanford  professors in the Design Department teach the most popular class at Stanford: Designing Your Life.  This is their book with the same goal.\"<br/> <br/>\n",
      "\tHighlights: <br/> <br/>“For most people, passion comes after they try something, discover they like it, and develop mastery - not before. To put it more succinctly: passion is the result of a good life design, not the cause.” <br/><br/>\"<br/>“These are all gravity problems—meaning they are not real problems. Why? Because in life design, if it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem. Let’s repeat that. If it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem. It’s a situation, a circumstance, a fact of life. It may be a drag (so to speak), but, like gravity, it’s not a problem that can be solved.” <br/><br/>Gravity problems: if it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem. Two types of gravity problems: totally un-actionable and functionally un-actionable.  Either way, focus on finding actionable solutions to actionable problems\"<br/><br/>\"“That’s why you start where you are. Not where you wish you were. Not where you hope you are. Not where you think you should be. But right where you are.” <br/><br/><br/>“As a life designer, you need to embrace two philosophies: 1. You choose better when you have lots of good ideas to choose from. 2. You never choose your first solution to any problem.” <br/>\"<br/><br/><br/>\n",

It may have been an artifact of listening to the audiobook, but I listened intently but didn't finish with any form of life design plan.

      "\tBig Idea: <br/><br/>\"Public letter  to his son from an educated black man about the trials and tribulations of living in modern America, with insights into the life of minorities (and African-Americans in particular) and the realities of “race”. This is a book full of quotes. Lots of poetic illustrations of the realities, but I didn’t find many ideas for progress or future healing. <br/><br/>I see parallels to my personal criticisms of Sociology: “Here’s how the world is screwed up. No idea how to fix it.”\"<br/> <br/>\n",

I would have you be a conscious citizen of this terrible and beautiful world.” <br/><br/>“You are growing into consciousness, and my wish for you is that you feel no need to constrict yourself to make other people comfortable.”<br/><br/>\"“One cannot, at once, claim to be superhuman and then plead mortal error. I propose to take our countrymen’s claims of American exceptionalism seriously, which is to say I propose subjecting our country to an exceptional moral standard.” <br/><br/>“Not being violent enough could cost me my body. Being too violent could cost me my body. We could not get out.” <br/><br/>“Here is what I would like for you to know: In America, it is traditional to destroy the black body—it is heritage. Enslavement was not merely the antiseptic borrowing of labor—it is not so easy to get a human being to commit their body against its own elemental interest. And so enslavement must be casual wrath and random manglings, the gashing of heads and brains blown out over the river as the body seeks to escape. It must be rape so regular as to be industrial. There is no uplifting way to say this. I have no praise anthems, nor old Negro spirituals. The spirit and soul are the body and brain, which are destructible—that is precisely why they are so precious. And the soul did not escape. The spirit did not steal away on gospel wings. The soul was the body that fed the tobacco, and the spirit was the blood that watered the cotton, and these created the first fruits of the American garden. And the fruits were secured through the bashing of children with stovewood, through hot iron peeling skin away like husk from corn.” \"<br/><br/><br/>\n",

A reader will be able to generate a social graph of an idea, or a timeline of a concept, or a networked map of influence for any notion in the library. We’ll come to understand that no work, no idea stands alone, but that all good, true, and beautiful things are ecosystems of intertwined parts and related entities, past and present.” <br/><br/>“Thomas Jefferson understood that ideas were not really property, or if they were property they differed from real estate. He wrote, “He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.” If Jefferson gave you his house at Monticello, you’d have his house and he wouldn’t. But if he gave you an idea, you’d have the idea and he’d still have the idea.

      "\tBig Idea: <br/><br/>\"Change accelerates change and we’re moving toward self-reinforcing change that will go on for infinity. Correcting mistakes allows for progress, and stasis could only be preserved without error correction (therefore is immoral).  <br/><br/>“There is only one known phenomenon which, if it ever occurred, would have effects that did not fall off with distance, and that is the creation of a certain type of knowl- edge, namely a beginning of infinity. Indeed, knowledge can aim itself at a target, travel vast distances having scarcely any effect, and then utterly transform the destination.”<br/>\"<br/> <br/>\n",
      "\tHighlights: <br/> <br/>“The very existence of Athens, however peaceful, is a deadly threat to Sparta’s stasis. And therefore, in the long run, the condition for the continued stasis of Sparta (which means its continued existence, as they see it) is the destruction of progress in Athens (which from our perspective would constitute the destruction of Athens).”<br/><br/>“The scientific revolution was part of a wider intellectual revolution, the Enlightenment, which also brought progress in other fields, especially moral and political philosophy, and in the institutions of society. Unfortunately, the term ‘the Enlightenment’ is used by historians and philosophers to denote a variety of different trends, some of them violently opposed to each other. What I mean by it will emerge here as we go along. It is one of several aspects of ‘the beginning of infinity’, and is a theme of this book. But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.”<br/><br/>“Sparta has no philosophers. That’s because the job of a philosopher is to understand things better, which is a form of change, so they don’t want it. Another difference: they don’t honour living poets, only dead ones. Why? Because dead poets don’t write anything new, but live ones do. A third difference: their education system is insanely harsh; ours is famously lax. Why? Because they don’t want their kids to dare to question anything, so that they won’t ever think of changing anything.”<br/><br/><br/>\n",

      "\tHighlights: <br/> <br/>“Even worse, greedy bosses might curtail the workers’ freedom of movement through debt peonage or slavery. At the end of the Middle Ages, slavery was almost unknown in Christian Europe. During the early modern period, the rise of European capitalism went hand in hand with the rise of the Atlantic slave trade. Unrestrained market forces, rather than tyrannical kings or racist ideologues, were responsible for this calamity.” <br/><br/>This quote stuck with me most among many thoughts from this great book. <br/><br/>“The Scientific Revolution has not been a revolution of knowledge. It has been above all a revolution of ignorance. The great discovery that launched the Scientific Revolution was the discovery that humans do not know the answers to their most important questions.“<br/><br/>Such a beautiful analysis of the naturalist vs religious viewpoints\"<br/><br/>\"There is great discussion about the usefulness of untrue claims. The discussion of equality and the analysis of the Declaration of Independence were particularly thought provoking:<br/><br/>“According to the science of biology, people were not ‘created’. They have evolved. And they certainly did not evolve to be ‘equal’. The idea of equality is inextricably intertwined with the idea of creation. The Americans got the idea of equality from Christianity, which argues that every person has a divinely created soul, and that all souls are equal before God. However, if we do not believe in the Christian myths about God, creation and souls, what does it mean that all people are ‘equal’?”<br/><br/><br/>\n",

Through personal and narrative examples she tries to demonstrate how she thinks about work/life balnce, how careers are jungle gyms rather than ladders, and how we might find a future where women and men are not the same but are equal. <br/><br/>I don’t know whether it’s that she’s preaching to the choir and I already believe, a latent unrecognized sexism, or just a disconnect between her as a senior executive who’s been lucky and successful and the reality of most people, but this book was just OK to me.  I started and stopped the audiobook a couple times, both due to the current political climate (I read this as the Weinstein/Hollywood/Policical sexual harrassment scandals were ramping up), and because I didn't feel compelled by the narrative.  I'm glad that I have experienced it, but I was hoping for something better and groundbreaking or truly thought provoking. Maybe my expectations were just too high. The things that stuck with me were smaller things that were less related to the main theme, but mostly this was an ok business memoir. \"<br/> <br/>\n",
