Then you have lots of ideas (rather than wait and wait to have the idea of the century) and you try things out by doing them (chapters 4, 5, and 6), and then you make the best choice you can (chapter 8). As you do all this, including making choices that set you on one path for a number of years, you grow various aspects of your personality and identity that are nurtured and called upon by those experiencesâ€”you become more yourself. In this way, you energize a very productive cycle of growth, naturally evolving from being, to doing, to becoming. Then it all repeats, as the more-like-you version of you (your new being) takes the next step of doing, and so it goes.â€ù <br/><br/>Stanford  professors in the Design Department teach the most popular class at Stanford: Designing Your Life.  This is their book with the same goal.""<br/>Â <br/>Highlights:<br/>Â <br/>â€œFor most people, passion comes after they try something, discover they like it, and develop mastery - not before. To put it more succinctly: passion is the result of a good life design, not the cause.â€ù <br/><br/>""<br/>â€œThese are all gravity problemsâ€”meaning they are not real problems. Why? Because in life design, if itâ€™s not actionable, itâ€™s not a problem. Letâ€™s repeat that. If itâ€™s not actionable, itâ€™s not a problem. Itâ€™s a situation, a circumstance, a fact of life. It may be a drag (so to speak), but, like gravity, itâ€™s not a problem that can be solved.â€ù <br/><br/>Gravity problems: if itâ€™s not actionable, itâ€™s not a problem. Two types of gravity problems: totally un-actionable and functionally un-actionable.  Either way, focus on finding actionable solutions to actionable problems""<br/><br/>""â€œThatâ€™s why you start where you are. Not where you wish you were. Not where you hope you are. Not where you think you should be. But right where you are.â€ù <br/><br/><br/>â€œAs a life designer, you need to embrace two philosophies: 1. You choose better when you have lots of good ideas to choose from. 2. You never choose your first solution to any problem.â€ù <br/>""<br/><br/><br/>Actionable Items:<br/><br/>""Health/Work/Play/Love dashboard:<br/><br/>Consider updating Todoist to align with this framework?<br/>Align with 1 Big Thing idea and make sure there's something going for each at all times?<br/><br/>""<br/><br/>""Re-read/do the exercises in the book:<br/>Health/Work/Play/Love dashboard.

Being too violent could cost me my body. We could not get out.â€ù <br/><br/>â€œHere is what I would like for you to know: In America, it is traditional to destroy the black bodyâ€”it is heritage. Enslavement was not merely the antiseptic borrowing of laborâ€”it is not so easy to get a human being to commit their body against its own elemental interest. And so enslavement must be casual wrath and random manglings, the gashing of heads and brains blown out over the river as the body seeks to escape. It must be rape so regular as to be industrial. There is no uplifting way to say this. I have no praise anthems, nor old Negro spirituals. The spirit and soul are the body and brain, which are destructibleâ€”that is precisely why they are so precious. And the soul did not escape. The spirit did not steal away on gospel wings. The soul was the body that fed the tobacco, and the spirit was the blood that watered the cotton, and these created the first fruits of the American garden. And the fruits were secured through the bashing of children with stovewood, through hot iron peeling skin away like husk from corn.â€ù ""<br/><br/><br/>Actionable Items:<br/><br/>No idea<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Other Notes & Takeaways:<br/>This was a prodfoundly poetic book, and beautiful, if tragic, letter from a father to son.

Correcting mistakes allows for progress, and stasis could only be preserved without error correction (therefore is immoral).  <br/><br/>â€œThere is only one known phenomenon which, if it ever occurred, would have effects that did not fall off with distance, and that is the creation of a certain type of knowl- edge, namely a beginning of infinity. Indeed, knowledge can aim itself at a target, travel vast distances having scarcely any effect, and then utterly transform the destination.â€ù<br/>""<br/>Â <br/>Highlights:<br/>Â <br/>â€œThe very existence of Athens, however peaceful, is a deadly threat to Spartaâ€™s stasis. And therefore, in the long run, the condition for the continued stasis of Sparta (which means its continued existence, as they see it) is the destruction of progress in Athens (which from our perspective would constitute the destruction of Athens).â€ù<br/><br/>â€œThe scientific revolution was part of a wider intellectual revolution, the Enlightenment, which also brought progress in other fields, especially moral and political philosophy, and in the institutions of society. Unfortunately, the term â€˜the Enlightenmentâ€™ is used by historians and philosophers to denote a variety of different trends, some of them violently opposed to each other. What I mean by it will emerge here as we go along. It is one of several aspects of â€˜the beginning of infinityâ€™, and is a theme of this book. But one thing that all conceptions of the Enlightenment agree on is that it was a rebellion, and specifically a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.â€ù<br/><br/>â€œSparta has no philosophers. Thatâ€™s because the job of a philosopher is to understand things better, which is a form of change, so they donâ€™t want it. Another difference: they donâ€™t honour living poets, only dead ones. Why? Because dead poets donâ€™t write anything new, but live ones do. A third difference: their education system is insanely harsh; ours is famously lax. Why? Because they donâ€™t want their kids to dare to question anything, so that they wonâ€™t ever think of changing anything.â€ù<br/><br/><br/>Actionable Items:<br/><br/>Um<br/><br/>Uh<br/><br/>Reread maybe?<br/><br/>Other Notes & Takeaways:<br/>Not sure what everyone who liked this was actually getting out of it. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Format Consumed:<br/>Audiobook",,,1,,,0,,,,,23692271,Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,"Harari, Yuval Noah",,,,4,4.45,Harvill Secker,Paperback,443,2014,2011,12/17/18,1/27/18,,,read,"The Big Idea:<br/><br/>Thought provoking look at the history of humanity that roughly follows the evolutionary history of homo sapiens sapiens and highlights the inflection points of cognitive, agricultural, and scientific revolutions. <br/>Â <br/>Highlights:<br/>Â <br/>â€œEven worse, greedy bosses might curtail the workersâ€™ freedom of movement through debt peonage or slavery.

Maybe my expectations were just too high. The things that stuck with me were smaller things that were less related to the main theme, but mostly this was an ok business memoir. ""<br/>Â <br/>Highlights:<br/>Â <br/>""â€œLeadership is about making others better as a result of your presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence.""""<br/>(Harvard Business School definition of leadership). This really stuck with me as a quality definition of Leadership, and one I directly aspire to emulate""<br/><br/>â€œCareers are a jungle gym, not a best parts of the book that aligned with the main theme were related to this. <br/><br/>â€œSuccess and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively for women. When a man is successful, he is liked by both men and women. When a woman is successful, people of both genders like her less.â€ù I already groked this, which might be why much of the book fell flat for me. <br/><br/><br/>Actionable Items:<br/><br/>Work on my own definition and process for receiving/giving mentoring<br/><br/>Actively solicit advice/request feedback<br/><br/>Manage my career/life, maybe set up Personal Board of Directors<br/><br/>Other Notes & Takeaways:<br/>""Mentoring:<br/>-Pointed questions, tailored to audience<br/>-Do homework on who you are talking to and what you are asking<br/>-Donâ€™t ask for a mentor, ask for specific help<br/><br/>Soliciting advice/requesting feedback:<br/>-What can I do better?<br/>-Commitment to Weekly feedback: allows boss/employee, mentor/mentee, coach/player to be aired and discussed quickly<br/><br/>Maternal gate keeping: mom telling dad what to do<br/>""<br/><br/><br/><br/>Format Consumed:<br/>Audiobook",,,1,,,0,,,,,27213329,Grit,Angela Duckworth,"Duckworth, Angela",,1443442313,9781443442312,4,4.07,Collins,Hardcover,352,2016,2016,,10/26/17,,,read,"The Big Idea<br/><br/>Success equals effort times skill.
